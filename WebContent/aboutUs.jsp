			<h2>Overview of Our Topic Area</h2>

				<hr>
				<div class="container-fluid text-left paddingright">
				 
				A startup is a young company that is still in its first stages of operation [1]. 
				To distinguish it from small businesses, entrepreneur Steve Blank adds that a startup is "an organization formed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model" [2]. 
				Often these companies are charaterized by a
				startup culture, where business agility, adaptability and creativity are key values [3]. One of the biggest challenges that they face
				is hiring new talent since, due to their small size, every hire matters [4]. Finding individuals with the right personality, range of skills
				and culture fit plays a large role in their hiring process [5][6]. The smaller the startup, the higher up the position
				within the startup that does the hiring. They tend to put job postings on online job boards, and university career boards.
				Overall though, most startups have indicated a preference for hiring through personal networks and career fairs [7]. This is where StartU
				comes in, and attempts to not only give startups the ability to teach others about their company, but also allows them to network with potential 
				hires. On the flip side, students now have a compiled repository of startups, which they can search to find ones that interest them, 
				as well as the ability to meet with representatives from these companies in person.
