			<h2>Overview of Our Topic Area</h2>

				A Startup is a young company that is still in its first stages of operation. Often these companies are charaterized by a
				startup culture, where business agility, adaptability and creativity are key values. With their limited size, individual talent
				and fit with the existing team dynamic play a large role in their hiring process []. The smaller the startup, the higher up the position
				within the startup that does the hiring. They tend to put job postings on online job boards, and university career boards.
				Overall though, most startups have indicated a preference for hiring through personal networks and career fairs [3]. This is where StartU
				comes in, and attempts to not only give startups the ability to teach others about their company, but also allows them to network with potential 
				hires. On the flip side, students now have a compiled repository of startups, which they can search to find ones that interest them, 
				as well as the ability to meet with representatives from these companies in person.
